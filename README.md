Domain that is modeled by this database:

Oftentimes, parents come to pick up their children at the childcare center and ask what
they have done for the day. The database models what the child does in the childcare, such as
what activity they did or what food they had for lunch. It also helps the childcare keep track of
the families that it services and the caretakers that it hires.
